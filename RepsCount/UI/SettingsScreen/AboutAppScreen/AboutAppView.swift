This app has just launched!
There are several features available for you.\n
1. You can optionally add weight to your reps.
2. You can add notes to an exercise.
3. You can see specific dates on the main list with your exercises.
4. Time counts from the first rep till the last one.
5. You cannot edit (add new reps, or remove existing reps) on the next day. But you still can remove the entire exercise if you'd like.
